				This template is meant to serve as a starting point for and demonstration of interoperating between
				JavaScript and WASM in a way in which the web side retains most of the control.

				The rust module is exposed to the global namespace under the <code>RustModule</code> object. You can
				explore its functions by pressing <code>.</code> after its name in the browser console.
			</p>
			<p>
				Try calling <code>RustModule.hello_alert()</code>: You just called a Rust function from JavaScript and
				that Rust function called a browser function as imported from <code>gloo::dialogs</code>!
